# Networks_Protocol_from_Demodulation_to_Decoding
ðŸ”—introduction 

Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) technology has been shown to be very promising for connecting millions of devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) by providing long-distance and low-power communication under a very low SNR. LoRa, as a representative LPWAN technology, has recently been widely adopted in both academia and industry [1â€“4]. It has been used in various IoT applications, e.g., smart city, smart agriculture, and smart logistics [5â€“8]. It also attracts a large
